Crash data is obtained from the Texas Department of Transportation (TXDOT) Crash Record Information System (CRIS) database, which is populated by reports submitted by Texas Peace Officers throughout the state, including Austin Police Department (APD), and maintained by TXDOT.
This dataset contains crash-level records for crashes which have occurred in the last ten years. Crash data may take several days or weeks to be initially provided and finalized as it is furnished to the Austin Transportation & Public Works Department, therefore a two-week delay is implemented to help ensure more accurate and complete results.
Please note that the data and information on this website is for informational purposes only. While we seek to provide accurate information, please note that errors may be present and information presented may not be complete.
